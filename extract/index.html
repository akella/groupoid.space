As was shown with interactions nets it is possible to compact
packaging of inductive construction in silicon, giving back
the inner language of space to the natural encoding.
If you are interesting in boosting this project forward and
have vision how to do it please drop us a line at <a href="http://gitter.im/groupoid/exe">gitter.im/groupoid/exe</a> public.
</p><h2 id="erlang">Erlang</h2><p>From the practical point of view, we are developing Erlang with Dependent Types.
Thus we carefully integrate into Erlang platform by the generation of Erlang AST
and trying to be compatible with Erlang kernel through mapping of inductive types
to underlying erlang primitives such as process, receive and spawn.
Erlang extraction is sponsored and supported by Synrc Research Center.</p></article><footer class="footer"><img class="footer__logo" src="/stamp.svg"><span class="footer__copy">2016&mdash;2017 &copy; Groupoid Infinity, Inc.</span></footer></body></html>
