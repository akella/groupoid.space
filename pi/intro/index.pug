                    Pi calculus can be transformed from lambda
                    calculus by replacing a variable constructor with stream constructor.
                    But the language and protocol accessing this stream could vary
                    from backend to backend with respect to design requirements.

                    Pi calculus is also known as a process calculus that can be used to model of distributed system
                    over a channel transport. Each process presented as coinductive program and is able
                    to be runned both in parallel and sequentially. Processes are communicating by inductive protocols
                    known as session types over physical channels that can be corecursive streams (linear types),
                    random access arrays (static lifetime) or other effectful disciplines. Process calculus
                    is used to model distributed systems such as Erlang or application based protocols.

                    The process calculus itself should be backed with number of infinity streams,
                    represented as processor cores. The parallel system of reactive shcedulers
                    that cycle the list of AST trees filled with calculus instructions.
