            h2 HN Language
            p.
                HN is an implicitly typed language.
                The type inference algorithm is complete, so there are no type annotations.
                The primitives are very similar to the original Milner's proposal for ML language:
                lexically scoped variables, functions, assignments, loops and conditionals.
            h2 Syntax
            p.
                 The language is divided onto expressions and types. The expressions is
                 in essence the lamda caclulus enriched with Let constructor. The type
                 schemes could be function types, simple constant types and
                 parametrised polymorphic container types.
            code.
                    Inductive E := Var: name → E
                                 | App: E → E → E
                                 | Lambda: name → E → E
                                 | Let: name → E → E.
            code.
                    Inductive T := Simple: name → T
                                 | Parametrized: name → list name → T
                                 | Var: name → T
                                 | Arrow: T → T → T.
            p.
                However, HN is a compiler intermediate language for human-readable code generation,
                so there are many limitations compared to what you ususally expect from an ML dialect.

            p.
                Limitations:

        p.
            Concrete syntax is rigid. Whitespace is not flexible so there
            is only one way to format the code, you cannot even indent
            by spaces or put two spaces instead of one. There are no comments either.

        code.
                hnMain = {
                    g x count = {
                        f xx = _or (eq 0 (mod xx 5)) (eq 0 (mod xx 3))
                        _if (f x) (sum count x) count
                    }
                    print (natrec g 0 999)
                }
        p.
            The abstract syntax is defined in `Parser.AST` module by mutually recursive
            algebraic data types, nothing unusual or exotic here:
        code.

                data LetIn a = Let (Definition a) (LetIn a)
                             | In (Expression a)

                data Definition a = Definition a [a] (LetIn a)
                                  | Assign a (LetIn a)
                                  | While Expression LetIn
                                  | If Expression LetIn LetIn

                data Expression a = Application (Expression a) [Expression a]
                                  | Atom a
                                  | Constant Const

                data Const = ConstString String
                           | ConstInt    Int
        p.
            The AST has two forms: the parser returns `Definition String` but
            optimizer converts it into `Definition Label` with unambiguously resolved names.
        p.
            The `Parser.Parser` module contains two parsers - `program` and `identifier`
            and Parsec library is the only dependency.
        p.
            Put `min-parser.hs` to the project root:

        code.
            import Parser.Parser
            import Text.Parsec.ByteString

            main = parseFromFile program "hn_tests/euler1.hn" >>= print

        code.
            $ cabal exec runhaskell -- -Wno-tabs min-parser.hs

            Right [Definition "hnMain" [] (Let (Definition "g" ["x","count"] 
            (Let (Definition "f" ["xx"] (In "_or" "eq" 0 "mod" "xx" 5 "eq" 0
            "mod" "xx" 3)) (In "_if" "f" "x" "sum" "count" "x" "count"))) (
            In "print" "natrec" "g" 0 999))]
